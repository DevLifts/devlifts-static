            <p class="question">
              I’m not interested in becoming a bodybuilder. Is DevLifts for me?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              Yes! We will have plans suited for all sorts of goals and lifestyles. You set your goals. We're here to provide you with
              resources and motivation to achieve them.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
              Are you qualified to be giving fitness advice?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              Firstly, Thad is a certified personal trainer, and J.C. is currently an ACE personal training candidate. Thad will be making
              and signing off on the plans until J.C. finishes his certification.
              <br>
              <br> Secondly, J.C. is a developer himself who has experienced firsthand some of the health problems brought on
              by the average developer lifestyle. Not only will this influence all the training and recommendations given
              by DevLifts, but it also means there’s a great deal of empathy he will be able to have for everyone.

            <p class="question">
              How is DevLifts different from existing fitness sites?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              Firstly, we're specialized. To our knowledge, DevLifts is the only developer-centric fitness community on the Internet. Everything
              we do revolves around helping you, the developer, achieve a healthier lifestyle. This means you benefit from
              a highly targeted approach and an encouraging, like-minded community to keep you going.
              <br>
              <br> Secondly, no fluff. We're not here to waste your time or play games with you — we're here to help you feel
              better, look better, and live longer. And all our content and programming will be published to that end.

              Only in the ways it needs to be.

              <strong>Less expensive.</strong> Thad works as a traditional private trainer for his day job, and his lowest-paying
              client still racks up a $360/month bill.
              <br>
              <br>

              <strong>No chaperones.</strong> We get that it can be uncomfortable having someone look over your shoulder and chit-chatting
              while you’re trying to work out. That’s another beauty of DevLifts: all the expertise of a certified personal
              trainer — without the trainer.

            <p class="question">
              How is fit.Start() different from your other plans?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              fit.Start() is aimed at being an affordable solution for developers looking to get fit. All the programming is created with
              an emphasis on building functional strength and improving long-term wellness.
            </p>

          <!-- .question-group -->

          <div class="question-group">
            <p class="question">
              What will the workouts be like? Will they be hard?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              The workouts will mostly be centered around building functional strength (strength you can actually use
              <em>in real life</em>) vs just being strong for strength's sake. We will aim to also emphasize mobility (range
              of motion you can actively use), which will make you less prone to injury both during the workouts and in your
              daily life.
              <br>
              <br> The workouts will be challenging, but nothing you can't handle! Even if you are unable to finish a workout,
              we design the programming in a way that you can still benefit from the work you
              <em>did</em> do. Don't worry about whether you'll finish a workout or not &mdash; the most important thing right
              now is that you
              <strong>start</strong>.

              What kind of equipment will I need?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              Most workouts can be done with standard gym equipment, although we will also provide alternate bodyweight and/or kettlebell
              movements where possible so you can do the workouts from anywhere.
              <br>
              <br> We may recommend you pick up a couple of things (such as a kettlebell or foam roller), but don't worry if
              you don't have a gym membership.

            <p class="answer">
              When you sign up, you'll have one of three options: a keto diet, a paleo diet, or a macros-based diet.
              <br>
              <br> Each month, we'll provide any details you may need, where applicable. We'll also provide tips and recipes.
              You'll also have access to our private Slack Community, so you can always discuss your diet with other members
              and ask questions.
