      <p>
        We exist because I know what it’s like to be a developer and start accepting aches &amp; pains, depression, anxiety, bad sleep, weight gain, and a host of other health problems as reality. It wasn’t until I started changing my lifestyle that I discovered these problems didn’t have to be my reality. We exist because I want other developers to come to the same realization. We exist because we want to help them learn how to cultivate a healthy lifestyle.
