              <p class="question">
                Are you qualified to be giving fitness advice?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Firstly, Thad is a certified personal trainer, and J.C. is
                currently an ACE personal training candidate. Thad will be
                making and signing off on the plans until J.C. finishes his
                certification. <br />
                <br />
                Secondly, J.C. is a developer himself who has experienced
                firsthand some of the health problems brought on by the average
                developer lifestyle. Not only will this influence all the
                training and recommendations given by DevLifts, but it also
                means there’s a great deal of empathy he will be able to have
                for everyone.

                How is DevLifts different from existing fitness sites?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Firstly, we're specialized. To our knowledge, DevLifts is the
                only developer-centric fitness community on the Internet.
                Everything we do revolves around helping you, the developer,
                achieve a healthier lifestyle. This means you benefit from a
                highly targeted approach and an encouraging, like-minded
                community to keep you going. <br />
                <br />
                Secondly, no fluff. We're not here to waste your time or play
                games with you — we're here to help you feel better, look
                better, and live longer. And all our content and programming
                will be published to that end.

                How is DevLifts different from hiring a personal trainer?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Only in the ways it needs to be. <br />
                <br />

                <strong>Less expensive.</strong> Thad works as a traditional
                private trainer for his day job, and his lowest-paying client
                still racks up a $360/month bill. <br />
                <br />

                <strong>No chaperones.</strong> We get that it can be
                uncomfortable having someone look over your shoulder and
                chit-chatting while you’re trying to work out. That’s another
                beauty of DevLifts: all the expertise of a certified personal
                trainer — without the trainer. <br />
                <br />

                <strong>Community.</strong> Benefit from a community of
                like-minded developers who are on this journey with you. We
                haven’t met any personal trainers with membership forums or
                Slack channels. <br />

            <div class="question-group">
              <p class="question">How do I track my progress?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                Tracking your progress is essential to ensuring you’re on the
                right track. Plus, watching the numbers improve is a huge way to
                stay motivated! <br />
                <br />First off, one of the best ways to track progress is with
                photos. This will give you a tangible reference for how far
                you’ve come when it feels like you aren’t making progress.
                <br />
                <br />If the thought of taking photos of yourself half-naked is
                mortifying, fear not — these photos can be for your eyes and
                your eyes only (and maybe the NSA’s). Of course, you’re welcome
                to share your photos in the #progress channel in Slack — it can
                be great to have others encouraging you along the way!

            <div class="question-group">
              <p class="question">What metrics should I track?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                As a baseline, you should take photos to track your progress.
                However, if you love data and want to see the numbers, here are
                some additional things you can track if you’d like: <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Energy & Mood</strong> <br />
                <br />
                Just keeping tabs on how you’re feeling as you progress can be
                really helpful! This can be as simple as a quick note in your
                journal or phone each evening rating your overall energy levels
                and mood throughout the day. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Weight</strong> <br />
                <br />
                This can fluctuate based on lots of things, including muscle
                mass, body fat, water retention, and glycogen depletion. So
                don’t put too much stock in your weight, but use it to track
                trends. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Body Fat</strong> <br />
                <br />
                There are a lot of methods to measure body fat, and each one
                comes with a different level of convenience and cost. In our
                experience, the best bang for your buck is the
                <a
                  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYZMYK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FYZMYK&linkCode=undefined&tag=jchiatt-20&linkId=0be124420d8b97e4c5cd3d88e04424b8"

                  >Omron Fat Loss Monitor</a
                >. It can be off a bit (high or low) depending on a number of
                factors, but it’ll still give you a great baseline number to
                measure against. <br />
                <br />
                If you track your weight and/or body fat, we recommend weighing
                yourself and taking your body fat measurement every morning,
                without clothes, and before consuming anything. This will give
                you the most accurate measurements. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Keep a pen and notebook in your
                bathroom (or wherever your scale is) so you can easily write
                down your numbers each morning. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Strength</strong> <br />
                <br />
                As you progress through the workouts, keep a log of your weights
                and reps so you can track how your strength is progressing over
                time!

              <p class="question">How do I take progress photos?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                Taking a good progress photo is an art. Here are some tips to
                make your progress photos as nice and helpful as possible:
                <br />
                <br />
                1. Wear minimal clothing. This can be as minimal as you’d like,
                but less is more here because it will help you see more parts of
                your body change over time. <br />
                <br />
                2. Make sure you have good lighting. <br />
                <br />
                3. Take your photos at least every two weeks (same day of the
                week and time, if possible) and in the same room with the same
                background and lighting. The goal is to re-create the same photo
                every time you take it. <br />
                <br />
                4. For your starting photos, don’t pose. Keep your body relaxed.
                You can flex and show off your progress in future photos! <br />
                <br />
                5. If possible, take your progress photos hands-free. You can
                set your phone up on a timer or have your spouse or partner take
                the photos.
              </p>

            <div class="question-group">
              <p class="question">How do I determine what weight to lift?</p>
              <p class="answer">
                This will be mostly trial and error. You'll get more comfortable
                picking weights pretty quickly, but starting off you'll have to
                tweak as you go. <br />
                <br />
                If you can't complete the set, drop the weight. But if you're
                bursting through the top of the rep range with little
                difficulty, go ahead and increase. If your first set is way too
                easy, count it as a warmup and use a heavier weight for your
                first set. <br />
                <br />
                Tracking your workouts becomes very important here.

              <p class="question">
                When should I take my peri-workout supplements?
              </p>
              <p class="answer">
                Let's break it down by common supplements: <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Pre-workout supplements:</strong> take within 20-30
                minutes before your workout. Any longer and you’ll get jittery
                (which can actually benefit you sometimes). <br />
                <br />
                <strong>BCAA powder:</strong> if you’re only taking BCAA’s once
                per day, sip on them throughout your workout. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>BCAA capsules:</strong> 20-30 minutes pre-workout. If
                you’d like more, do so immediately after. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Protein powder:</strong> if only taking once, do so
                immediately post-workout. If more, you can benefit from 30
                minutes before as well, which we highly recommend if you’re
                working out first thing in the morning. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Fast-digesting carbs:</strong> whether it’s a simple
                carb supplement, fruit, sugary candy, or some home-concocted mad
                scientist formula, you’ll benefit most from taking them
                immediately after your workout. If you can afford to add more,
                you’ll also benefit from taking some directly before, especially
                if your workout is cardio-intensive. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Creatine:</strong> hook up an IV and let it flow freely
                at all times. Okay fine. Take 5g before and 5g after. For years,
                it was generally accepted that you should cycle creatine dosing,
                but further study has shown that this is not necessary. Take 10g
                total throughout your off days. There are several forms of
                creatine out there. Go for “monohydrate”. It’ll say it clearly
                on the label.

                to be in flux, as we'll dial in your nutrition on an ongoing
                basis as you plateau or if your goals change. <br />
                <br />You'll also have access to our private Slack Community, so
                you can always discuss your diet with other members and ask
                questions (our #nutrition channel is really helpful).
