            J.C. has worked as a web developer in Jackson, MS, for six years,
            where he currently lives with his wife Haleigh. Under co-founder
            Thad’s programming, he first began to develop his fitness in 2015.
            His primary focus is powerlifting and bodybuilding, but he also

            Thad splits his time between Jackson, MS, and Lesvos, Greece, paying
            the bills as a personal trainer and volunteering in a refugee camp,
            respectively. Currently, his primary focus is olympic weightlifting
            and athletic conditioning, although his fitness journey has been
            shaped by his life, resulting in the development a range of
            interests, including high school athletics, bodybuilding, obstacle
            course racing, crossfit, bodyweight travel workouts, and
            powerlifting.

            We exist because I know what it’s like to be a developer and start
            accepting aches &amp; pains, depression, anxiety, bad sleep, weight
            gain, and a host of other health problems as reality. It wasn’t
            until I started changing my lifestyle that I discovered these
            problems didn’t have to be my reality. We exist because I want other
            developers to come to the same realization. We exist because we want
            to help them learn how to cultivate a healthy lifestyle.

      <h3>How did it start</h3>
      <hr />

      <h2>We were exactly where you are now</h2>

      <p>
        DevLifts founder J.C. noticed his health deteriorating in the summer of
        2015. The owner of a web shop in Jackson, MS, his life mainly consisted
        of sitting, eating, and being stressed. These compounded into poor
        sleep, low energy, aches and pains, and 50 pounds of weight gain over
        the previous four years.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, DevLifts co-founder Thad, a friend from high school,
        had become a personal trainer and was living in town. During the fall of
        2015, Thad trained J.C. in the gym and in the kitchen, teaching him how
        to make healthy, sustainable changes to his life and more importantly,
        how to make them stick. In fact, when Thad left the country for a year
        of volunteering, J.C. was able to keep up his new habits without
        requiring Thad’s supervision.
      </p>

      <p>
        On Thad’s re-entry to the States, J.C. approached him with an idea — to
        partner together and give other developers what Thad gave J.C. in 2015.
        To create a community where developers can come together and learn more
        about training, nutrition, and themselves. To help individuals who are
        constantly forced into unhealthy environments understand that it doesn’t
        have to be that way.
