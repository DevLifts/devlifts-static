              We exist because I know what it’s like to be a developer and start accepting aches &amp; pains, depression, anxiety, bad sleep, weight gain, and a host of other health problems as reality. It wasn’t until I started changing my lifestyle that I discovered these problems didn’t have to be my reality. We exist because I want other developers to come to the same realization. We exist because we want to help them learn how to cultivate a healthy lifestyle.

            I’m not interested in becoming a bodybuilder. Is DevLifts for me?

            Yes! We will have plans suited for all sorts of goals and lifestyles. You set your goals. We're here to provide you with resources and motivation to achieve them.

            Why are you only accepting 100 customers right now?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Both of us are building DevLifts on the side (in addition to our existing jobs). Therefore, we each have a limited amount of time to dedicate to our initial intake calls. We don’t want you to sign up and then have to wait 6 weeks before you get your call, so we decided to limit the amount of customers we’re taking on at one time, at least for now.

          <p class="question">
            Are you qualified to be giving fitness advice?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Firstly, Thad is a NASM certified personal trainer, and J.C. is currently an ACE personal training candidate. Thad will be making and signing off on the plans until J.C. finishes his certification.<br><br>
            
            Secondly, J.C. is a developer himself who has experienced firsthand some of the health problems brought on by the average developer lifestyle. Not only will this influence all the training and recommendations given by DevLifts, but it also means there’s a great deal of empathy he will be able to have for everyone.

          <p class="question">
            How is DevLifts different from existing fitness sites?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Firstly, we're specialized. To our knowledge, DevLifts is the only developer-centric fitness community on the Internet. Everything we do revolves around helping you, the developer, achieve a healthier lifestyle. This means you benefit from a highly targeted approach and an encouraging, like-minded community to keep you going.<br><br>
            
            Secondly, no fluff. We're not here to waste your time or play games with you — we're here to help you feel better, look better, and live longer. And all our content and programming will be published to that end.

        <div class="question-group">
          <p class="question">
            How is DevLifts different from hiring a personal trainer?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Only in the ways it needs to be.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Less expensive.</strong> Thad works as a traditional private trainer for his day job, and his lowest-paying client still racks up a $360/month bill.<br><br>
            
            <strong>No chaperones.</strong> We get that it can be uncomfortable having someone look over your shoulder and chit-chatting while you’re trying to work out. That’s another beauty of DevLifts: all the expertise of a certified personal trainer — without the trainer.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Community.</strong> Benefit from a community of like-minded developers who are on this journey with you. We haven’t met any personal trainers with membership forums or Slack channels.<br><br>
